  spec is map containing:
    ::retry?   - A predicate called after an exception to determine
                 whether body should be retried. Takes three args:
                 eval-count, exec-duration-ms, and the exception/failing value.
    ::delay    - A function which calculates the delay in millis to
                 wait prior to the next evaluation. Takes three args:
                 eval-count, exec-duration-ms, and the exception/failing value.
    ::success? - (Optional) A function which takes a return value and determines
                 whether it was successful. If false, body is retried.
                 Defaults to (constantly true)."
